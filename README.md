# Change Log App Challenge

## Description 

This project is a challenge for a selection process for an internship.

The object of the project is to create a RESTful API for a Change Log App that allows a product manager or an engineer to post projects/products updates for the team to see and keep track of the timelines of each one of them and show the stakeholders the progress made.

## Requirements

- Each project should have updates, and each update should have relevant points. You can add as many entities as you want, as long as it follows a business logic to meet the requirements.
- The API must be able to return data in JSON format.
- The API should provide <ins>filter capabilities</ins> for the projects. Allowing consumers of the API can search projects by date of publication, creator, or name of the project for example.
- The API should be able to support <ins>pagination</ins>.
- The API should have <ins>authentication</ins> methods for users to sign up and sign into the platform. An unauthenticated user shouldn't be able to see the internal projects and their updates.
- Every user in the platform should be able to create, read, update and delete projects.
